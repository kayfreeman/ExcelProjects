## Project Overview
FutureTale Hotel speaks dynamic modernity. The Chinese Restaurant, Japanese Gourmet Restaurant, Lobby Lounge & Bars, and Grand Ballroom, as well as the guest rooms and suites, meet the most exacting comfort and service standards.
FutureTale Hotel has noticed inconsistencies in its returns from 2017 to 2018. Being a modern relaxation center with a booking platform, A significant number of hotel reservations are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests, but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.
